Note taking app where each note can have child notes making a note tree.
● Generated an editable note tree via Mongo & Shelf.
● Traverses, creates, & updates notes via flutter & dio.
● Showed alternate content if no streamable notes were found.

This was made for video game note taking but can be changed to work with anything. The tasks feature that appears on the right side of the note will become modular in the future.

Main code is in client/lib, server/bin, & server/lib.

Brief Installation instructions:
1. Install Flutter dart.
2. Install Mongo Community and select the use mongo as a service option when it prompts you.
3. Save the bin folder from your Mongo Community installation to your path environments. Type mongo in your cmd to run it.
4. Run the server and client separately. With flutter you can run the client side from many devices like your phone.
5. Now you can take notes from your phone or computer.
